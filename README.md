# ToDo List app
ToDo List - mobile app build with AngularJS and Ionic Framework based on pp with AngularJS and Ionic Chris Nwamba's tutorial [Create Your First Mobile App with AngularJS and Ionic](https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-your-first-mobile-app-with-angularjs-and-ionic)

#### Overview
IÂ´ve fixed some 'errors' I've found on the tutorial and I've added a more AngularJS like code structure to the application since there's always a gap between tutorials and working environments, I did some tweaking to the gulp file although it's not necessary at this point.

## Installation
Clone the repository and run:
```
npm install -g cordova ionic
bower install
```
##Usage
To run the app on your desktop execute the command ```'ionic serve --lab```
